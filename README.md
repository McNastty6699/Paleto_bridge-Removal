# Paleto_bridge-Removal

Drag and Drop into your maps folder. 
Ensure or start in the cfg if you dont use a maps folder.

This is something i seen others try to do but failed. 
so i decided to do it just to see if i could learn anything from it.
It was easy but time consuming when it came to removing the collision.
